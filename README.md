# Shadowsocks for Asuswrt-Merlin New Gen

shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin will install `shadowsocks-libev` and `v2ray-plugin` on your Asuswrt-Merlin New Gen(version 382.xx and higher) based router, tested on NETGEAR R7000 and ASUS RT-AC86U.

For server side set up, you can easily install shadowsocks server and v2ray-plugin with docker by [https://github.com/Acris/docker-shadowsocks-libev](https://github.com/Acris/docker-shadowsocks-libev).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Asuswrt-Merlin New Gen(version 382.xx and higher) based router
- Entware **must** be installed, you can find installation documents on [https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Entware](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Entware)
- JFFS partition should be enabled
- ca-certificates should be installed for HTTPS support
- git and git-http should be installed
- wget should be installed

Make sure you have installed all prerequisites software and utils, you can install it by:
```sh
opkg update
opkg upgrade
opkg install ca-certificates git-http wget
```

### Installation
shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin is installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
sh -c "$(wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Acris/shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin@master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

### Configuration
#### Configure shadowsocks
The sample shadowsocks configuration file location is: `/opt/share/ss-merlin/etc/shadowsocks/config.sample.json`, ensure `local_address` is set to `0.0.0.0`.

We highly recommend to enable `v2ray-plugin` on your server side. You can set up your server in several command with: [https://github.com/Acris/docker-shadowsocks-libev](https://github.com/Acris/docker-shadowsocks-libev).

If you want to enable UDP support, you should set `mode` from `tcp_only` to `tcp_and_udp`.

For configuration file documents, you can go to: [https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev/blob/master/doc/shadowsocks-libev.asciidoc#config-file](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev/blob/master/doc/shadowsocks-libev.asciidoc#config-file)
```sh
# Copy and edit the shadowsocks configuration file
cd /opt/share/ss-merlin/etc/shadowsocks
cp config.sample.json config.json
vi config.json
```

#### Configure shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin
The sample shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin configuration file location is: `/opt/share/ss-merlin/etc/ss-merlin.sample.conf`. Currently, shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin support three mode:
- 0: GFW list.
- 1: Bypass mainland China.
- 2: Global mode.

You can also enable or disable UDP support to change `udp=0` or `udp=1`, ensure your server side support UDP and set `"mode": "tcp_and_udp"` in shadowsocks configuration file.
```sh
# Copy and edit the shadowsocks-asuswrt-merlin configuration file
cd /opt/share/ss-merlin/etc
cp ss-merlin.sample.conf ss-merlin.conf
vi ss-merlin.conf
```

Configure which LAN IP will pass transparent proxy by edit `lan_ips`, you can assign a LAN IP like 192.169.1.125 means only this device can pass transparent proxy.

And you can change the default DNS server for Chinese IPs by modifying `china_dns_ip`.

Then, start the service:
```sh
# Start the service
ss-merlin start
```

### Usage
```sh
admin@R7000:/tmp/home/root# ss-merlin 
 Usage: ss-merlin start|stop|restart|upgrade|uninstall
```

### Custom user rules

vi /opt/share/ss-merlin/rules/user_domain_name_blocklist.txt

# Force pass proxy

vi /opt/share/ss-merlin/rules/user_domain_name_gfwlist.txt
